Getting to know how to work with the photoresistor.
It was not until finding a decent guide that I was able to understand how to use it.
Trying to find refference material for the photoresistor was a bit difficult.
..

Connecting the power the wrong way was a bit of a problem. And i feelt the smell of heated electronics. but the board was not damaged, cat warned me in time. (No seriusly, my cat warned me in time.)
